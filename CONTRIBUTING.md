# Contributing Guide

Currently, this guide is mainly for me, as I am writing the book. I am using it to keep track of useful notes for proofreading.

When proofreading, consider:

1. `which` vs `that` - a common error, good guide here: https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/which-versus-that-0?page=1
2. `—` vs `-` - the first comes back from editors sometimes but doesn't render consistently
3. `–` vs `-` - as above.
